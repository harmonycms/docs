### What is HarmonyCMS?

HarmonyCMS is a free, open-source, self-hosted content management system platform based on **Symfony 4.1** framework.

### Where do I start?

The best way to get started is to go to the [Harmony Platform documentation](https://harmonycms.gitbook.io/platform) to know how Harmony works.  
After that, you can go to the [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) section to install HarmonyCMS on your own server.
