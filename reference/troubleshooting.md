## Memory limit errors

Installation may sometimes fail on some commands with this message:

```text
PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of XXXXXX bytes exhausted <...>
```

In that case, see the [Memory limit errors](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#memory-limit-errors) page for Composer.
