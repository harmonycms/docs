# Installation

We assume you’re familiar with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), a dependency manager for PHP. Use the following command to add the bundle to your **composer.json** and download the package.

```bash
composer require harmony/admin-bundle
```

> Alternatively, you can clone the [https://github.com/harmonycms/admin-bundle](https://github.com/harmonycms/admin-bundle) repository.
